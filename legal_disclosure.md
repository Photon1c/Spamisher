When using these technologies, ensure you provide explicit consent for your voice to be cloned and carefully review the terms of service to understand how your data will be used and protected. This approach helps maintain ethical standards and aligns with legal requirements.​

Additionally, be aware of the potential misuse of voice cloning technology, as there have been instances where cloned voices were used for fraudulent activities. For example, AI-cloned voices have been utilized in scams to impersonate individuals and deceive victims. To mitigate such risks, some companies are developing detection tools to identify AI-generated voices, aiming to prevent misuse and protect individuals' identities. ​
